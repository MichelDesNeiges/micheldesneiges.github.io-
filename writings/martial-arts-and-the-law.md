This three-part reflection explores parallels between the practice of law and the discipline of Kyokushin karate. Although written early in my legal career, it captures enduring themes that continue to inform my approach to advocacy: adversarial structure, ritual, respect, uncertainty, and balance.

## Introduction

I write this blog just a week before a major trial. But it will be a physical trial, not a legal one, and it will be held in a dojo, not a courtroom. Also, I will be the one on trial.

When I return to you in two weeks, I fully expect to be wearing a patchwork of bruises all over my body, and perhaps a black belt around my waist.

In the meantime, in the next three sections, I’ll present a few musings on my experiences in the martial arts—how the practice of karate helped me immensely in my legal studies and later as a practicing lawyer. It’s a philosophical take on how the two disciplines often mesh, and why I felt compelled to take on both at the same time.

Looking back, karate did more than condition my body. It conditioned how I approach conflict, authority, judgment, and restraint in legal practice.

## Part I — Yin and Yang

In 2003, I took up the martial art of Kyokushin Karate at essentially the same time I decided to go to law school. I started karate a bit late in life, in the same way I went to law school a bit later than most, in my early thirties. But the fact that I began both at the same time was by no means an accident, and I’m glad I did so. Both have much in common. Karate helped me prepare for a law degree and for a career as a lawyer.

It’s important for me to mention that I spent most of my 20s as an activist in the environmental and social justice movements after having grown up in the sporting milieu as a hockey athlete.

Having played at an elite level in hockey in my teens, I was exposed to the rigours of that sport and to the discipline imposed on players in a team environment. This was and still is a mostly non-questioning, hierarchical system. For the most part, I fit in rather well. I respected my coaches, I worked hard, and I took the game very seriously.

But there was also a side of me that resisted authority, that wanted to unleash creativity, and that needed to question. By my late teens, I started questioning much of the mentality that went hand in hand with organised sport and its trappings. So, just as I turned 20, I did a complete shift by leaving the game and eventually joining rebels, artists, and environmentalists.

I immersed myself in philosophical thought, studied social structures, and tried to find answers to major problems and existential questions with the enthusiasm and idealism typical of youth. Like many young North Americans, I also became enthralled with eastern religions such as Zen Buddhism, and I dedicated a lot of thought to them.

But living in an ideal state is impossible, and the attempt to do so is ultimately unsatisfying. I soon discovered the limits of my new social environment. The emphasis was more on thought than on action, and I remained mostly about the latter.

Although I had left the structures and rigours of the sporting milieu, I took my work as an environmentalist very seriously, especially when organizing campaigns—often to the point of feeling like a square peg in a round hole among my more relaxed friends.

That said, I knew that this all-questioning, rebel lifestyle had many virtues, and it was the place I wanted to be.

But such an attitude does not necessarily align well with the legal profession. Any doubt I had about that was answered when I first entered law school in 1994.

Unfortunately, I approached my legal studies with the same critical eye I used in assessing environmental and social problems—very critically. A word to the wise: when in law school, act as a sponge, not as a rock.

Not surprisingly, the law school experience soured quickly, and I was gone faster than I had entered.

I continued living among my more laid-back friends, basking in creative thinking and taking time to experience the full range of experiences that lifestyle had to offer. One of the most rewarding was backpacking in many regions of the world.

By the end of the 1990s, however, I felt I had more to do. I had explored many philosophies and theories, but I had not yet reached the balance I was seeking in life.

I came to realize that I missed physical exertion and discipline. It was time to quite literally move again. Two callings emerged clearly. In 2003, I once again enrolled in law school, and I joined a karate organization in Moncton.

## Part II — Learning the Art of Combat

As suggested above, I discovered on a hunch that the discipline of karate could go hand in hand with legal studies. Today, as a practicing lawyer, the compatibility of the two seems even clearer.

The major similarity is that both are forms of combat disguised in rituals and rules.

There is no doubt that the practice of law is adversarial in nature. In fact, the English Common Law tradition is explicitly described as an adversarial system.

In the common law, lawyers face off in front of a judge in a winner-take-all contest featuring aggressive legal tactics and strategies. That said, respect is expected to reign. To facilitate this, court proceedings are highly ritualised, and the rules of evidence are strict. These rules and traditions are meant to elevate discourse and behaviour. In Canada, lawyers wear robes, bow to the judge, and address the court and opposing counsel as “Your Honour” and “My Friend”.

Similarly, karate is combat. Although often referred to as the art of self-defence, fighting lies at its core. Karate competitions are also winner-take-all events.

Like the law, karate is highly structured. The dojo is a sacred place where one bows when entering and leaving. Karateka respect their teachers and elders through ritual and silence. They wear karategis, address instructors as “Sensei,” and respond with “Osu.”

The budo karate I practice places me in repeated one-on-one combat. We strike with full intensity, yet remain respectful. When the encounter ends, we shake hands. With that kind of intensity in the dojo, it becomes possible to approach courtroom conflict in the same spirit—minus the punches and kicks.

Both disciplines are underpinned by rich philosophical traditions. The common law is rooted in Western thought, influenced by Christianity and Greek philosophy, and aims at rationality, fairness, and justice.

Karate emerges from Eastern traditions shaped by Japanese culture and Zen Buddhism. Zen emphasizes compassion and detachment from ego—an influence deeply embedded in martial arts practice.

The teaching methods in both law and karate also share similarities. I have often been fascinated—and sometimes irritated—by law professors and karate instructors alike. Both maintain hierarchical structures and often teach by withholding information.

Law professors famously use the Socratic Method, calling on students to answer questions rather than delivering lectures. Given the workload and complexity of law school, many students fear being called upon unprepared.

Karate instructors use analogous methods: exhausting repetition, sudden questioning, and enigmatic explanations inspired by Zen teaching.

A classic Zen story illustrates this approach: a professor visits a Zen master to learn martial arts and boasts of his knowledge. The master pours tea into the professor’s cup until it overflows. When the professor protests, the master replies, “How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?”

Both legal and martial arts communities claim there are sound reasons for these methods. Whether they teach wisdom or simply weed out the weak remains debated.

After seven years of practicing both disciplines, I formed my own conclusions.

## Part III — Striking a Balance

In both legal theory and Zen philosophy, definitive answers are rare. Uncertainty is inherent, and this is reflected in teaching methods.

In law school, students may answer a question only to be told they are wrong or insufficient.

In karate, students may explain the purpose of a movement only to be told it serves another purpose entirely.

This can be frustrating. Yet there may be deeper reasons for placing students in such situations.

Sometimes the purpose is simple: to see who prepared. At other times, it is meant to provoke reflection about the discipline itself and its inherent complexity.

The law evolves with facts, social values, and judicial disagreement. A student must learn to live with that uncertainty.

In karate, being put on the spot forces the student to confront emotion and pressure. The lesson is serenity and composure in adversity.

That said, both the martial arts and the law are human institutions, led by imperfect people. While there are ideals worth pursuing, those in authority are not infallible.

Martial arts, having evolved for centuries in Asia, have adapted—some would say been distorted—by Western competitiveness and commercialization. Similarly, the legal profession suffers from poor public perception, adversarial excess, and institutional shortcomings.

Despite this, I have not abandoned the ideals underlying either discipline. Confronting their imperfections has led me to another realization: each of us must internalize these ideals and contribute personally to their advancement.

In their symbolic forms, both disciplines express powerful values. Martial arts teach perseverance, respect, intensity tempered by compassion, and balance—captured by the Yin Yang symbol.

The law, symbolized by the scales of justice, likewise emphasizes balance, fairness, and societal responsibility.

Perfection may be unattainable. But that is not the point. The martial arts teach that the goal is not perfection itself, but the constant striving for balance.

As I conclude this three-part reflection, I thank those who guided me to my black belt. Just as it takes a community to raise a child, it takes an entire dojo to shape a karateka. I wear my bruises like a badge of honour.

Osu.

## Author’s Note (2026)

More than a decade later, I still recognize the courtroom as a disciplined arena of conflict governed by rules, ritual, and restraint. Experience has only reinforced the central thesis of this piece: effective advocacy requires intensity without ego, preparation without rigidity, and respect even in disagreement.

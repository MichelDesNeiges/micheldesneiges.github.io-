      First published May 30, 2010. Edited for AI and republished here to reflect
      professional approach and legal reasoning. Some references reflect the

    <p>
      This three-part reflection explores parallels between the practice of law
      and the discipline of Kyokushin karate. Although written early in my legal
      career, it captures enduring themes that continue to inform my approach to
      advocacy: adversarial structure, ritual, respect, uncertainty, and balance.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      I write this blog just a week before a major trial. But it will be a
      physical trial, not a legal one, and it will be held in a dojo, not a
      courtroom. Also, I will be the one on trial.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I return to you in two weeks, I fully expect to be wearing a patchwork
      of bruises all over my body, and perhaps a black belt around my waist.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the meantime, in the next three sections, I’ll present a few musings on
      my experiences in the martial arts—how the practice of karate helped me
      immensely in my legal studies and later as a practicing lawyer. It’s a
      philosophical take on how the two disciplines often mesh, and why I felt
      compelled to take on both at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking back, karate did more than condition my body. It conditioned how I
      approach conflict, authority, judgment, and restraint in legal practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Part I — Yin and Yang</h2>

    <p>
      In 2003, I took up the martial art of Kyokushin Karate at essentially the
      same time I decided to go to law school. I started karate a bit late in
      life, in the same way I went to law school a bit later than most, in my
      early thirties.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both have much in common. Karate helped me prepare for a law degree and for
      a career as a lawyer.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s important for me to mention that I spent most of my 20s as an activist
      in the environmental movement after having grown up in the sporting milieu
      as a hockey athlete.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having played at an elite level in hockey in my teens, I was exposed to the
      rigours of that sport and to the discipline imposed on players in a team
      environment. This was and still is a mostly non-questioning, hierarchical
      system.
    </p>

    <p>
      But there was also a side of me that resisted authority, that wanted to
      unleash creativity, and that needed to question.
    </p>

    <p>
      By my late teens, I started questioning much of the mentality that went
      hand in hand with organised sport and its trappings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as I turned 20, I did a complete shift by leaving the game and
      eventually joining rebels, artists, and environmentalists.
    </p>

    <p>
      I immersed myself in philosophical thought, studied social structures, and
      tried to find answers to major problems and existential questions with the
      enthusiasm and idealism typical of youth.
    </p>

    <p>
      But living in an ideal state is impossible, and the attempt to do so is
      ultimately unsatisfying.
    </p>

    <p>
      I came to realize that I missed physical exertion and discipline. Two
      callings emerged clearly. In 2003, I once again enrolled in law school, and
      I joined a karate organization in Moncton.
    </p>

    <h2>Part II — Learning the Art of Combat</h2>

    <p>
      The major similarity is that both law and karate are forms of combat
      disguised in rituals and rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no doubt that the practice of law is adversarial in nature. Court
      proceedings are highly ritualised, and respect is expected to reign.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, karate is combat. The dojo is a sacred place. Practitioners bow,
      follow hierarchy, and strike with full intensity while remaining
      respectful.
    </p>

    <p>
      With that kind of intensity in the dojo, it becomes possible to approach
      courtroom conflict in the same spirit—minus the punches and kicks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both disciplines are underpinned by rich philosophical traditions. One
      emerges from Western legal rationalism, the other from Zen-inflected
      Japanese culture.
    </p>

    <h2>Part III — Striking a Balance</h2>

    <p>
      In both legal theory and Zen philosophy, definitive answers are rare.
      Uncertainty is inherent.
    </p>

    <p>
      In law school, students may answer a question only to be told they are
      wrong. In karate, a movement may reveal an entirely different purpose than
      first assumed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lesson is composure under pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both disciplines are human institutions, led by imperfect people.
      Perfection may be unattainable, but the striving for balance is not.
    </p>

    <p>
      Martial arts teach perseverance, respect, intensity tempered by compassion,
      and balance. The law, symbolized by the scales of justice, likewise
      emphasizes balance and responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wear my bruises like a badge of honour.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Osu.</strong></p>

    <h2>Author’s Note (2026)</h2>

    <p>
      More than a decade later, I still recognize the courtroom as a disciplined
      arena of conflict governed by rules, ritual, and restraint. Experience has
      only reinforced the central thesis of this piece.

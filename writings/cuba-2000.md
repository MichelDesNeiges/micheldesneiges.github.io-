**November 22nd, 2000.**  
Cancún, Mexico.

I’m sitting comfortably on an Aero Cubana flight, headed for Havana, when a flight attendant leans over, hands out candy, and asks if this is my first time in Cuba.

“Yes,” I tell her — in terrible Spanish.

*Primera vez.*

Then, in English: “I’ve been dying to go.”

And I mean it.

Images crowd my head.

The Bay of Pigs.  
The Missile Crisis.  
Kennedy and Khrushchev staring each other down.  
Pierre Trudeau visiting Havana in the seventies.

I’d been told Cuba hadn’t really changed since 1959.

I believe it — especially sitting in a Soviet-era airplane that looks like it hasn’t either.

I love takeoff. The engines spooling up. That moment right before you leave the ground.

These engines sound… aggressive. Pushed hard.

Maybe that’s just how these planes fly.

The wheels start rolling.

Then — *boom*.

An engine explodes behind my wing.

Everyone jumps. Looks around.

The plane keeps moving, the engines slowing — gently, reassuringly.

The pilot comes on the intercom, calm, routine.

Minor technical issues.

We taxi back to the terminal.

A tourist in front of me turns around and says, dry as hell:

“Welcome to Cuba.”

## Arrival

We sit in Cancún for twenty more hours.

When we finally land in Havana, customs takes two. Long. Frustrating.

When I step into the main terminal, late-afternoon sunlight pours through massive glass windows.

Ultra-modern. Almost disorienting.

Instead of rushing outside, I collapse onto a bench and close my eyes.

Exhausted.  
Impatient.  
A little disillusioned.

A soft voice breaks the silence.

I open my eyes to a beautiful woman in her forties, smiling, her hand resting gently on my knee.

She asks if she can help me understand the city map in my hands.

Of course, I already know what this is.

Her name is Isabella. She’s licensed to rent rooms in her home — one of the small openings in Cuba’s tightly controlled economy.

I say yes.

She leads me to her old blue Chevrolet — one of thousands of pre-revolution cars still rolling through Havana.

We pass the Plaza de la Revolución. A vast concrete stage where Fidel Castro has spoken to crowds of tens of thousands.

That night, settled in, the day’s chaos behind me, Isabella hands me my first Cuban cigar.

A gift.

## Havana

Havana is intoxicating.

Old Havana — a UNESCO World Heritage Site — is a maze of colonial architecture, museums, plazas, music spilling out of doorways.

Jazz.  
Rumba.  
Mambo.  
Son.

The city feels alive. Cosmopolitan. Proud.

But if you step off the tourist routes — really step off — another Havana appears.

Buildings crumbling. Paint peeling. Entire neighborhoods barely holding together.

The poverty isn’t hidden.

It’s no mystery why.

The U.S. embargo.  
The collapse of the Soviet Union — Cuba’s lifeline.  
Years of austerity.

Life here is hard.

I want to understand it better.

So over the next few days, with Isabella’s friend Enrique, I visit small towns. Farms. Ordinary places.

The contradictions are everywhere.

There’s scarcity — food, housing, transportation.

But there’s also sharing. A rough kind of equity.

Healthcare and education are universal. And good.

Cubans are fiercely proud of that.

## Revolution

Of course, not everyone agrees.

Thousands fled to the United States.

Castro is, undeniably, a dictator.

Human rights violations are real.

Cuba is not simple.

But one thing is undeniable: the endurance of its people.

---

## Pico Turquino

I see that endurance most clearly on Pico Turquino — the highest mountain in Cuba.

Deep in the Sierra Maestra. Where Castro’s rebels once hid.

I climb it with a group of Young Communists.

I have boots. A pack.

Most of them wear sneakers.

They sing as they walk.

After three hours, we reach camp — exhausted. It’s late. Too late.

A professional guide would stop here.

Ours doesn’t.

They press on.

The climb turns brutal. Steep. Fog rolls in. Night falls fast.

Near the top, it’s clear we won’t make it back before dark.

I hesitate.

Pride versus sense.

Finally, I turn back.

Angry. Exhausted. Furious at the guide. At them. At myself.

I reach camp after full darkness.

They don’t return until hours later. Some are injured.

The next day, we descend.

I want nothing to do with them.

Until later — during a nap — there’s a knock on my door.

Two young Cuban women stand there, shy smiles on their faces.

One holds out a bowl.

“Ice cream, Michel?”

## Closing

I experienced many highs and lows in Cuba.

Contradictions.  
Anger.  
Admiration.  
Doubt.

But again and again, what stayed with me wasn’t ideology.

It was warmth.  
Resilience.  
Human dignity.

Cuba is complicated.

And that — more than slogans, more than history — is what makes it unforgettable.

*Viva Cuba.*

**January 15th.** Just after seven in the morning.

I’m standing on top of a temple called *El Mundo Perdido* — “The Lost World.”

Below me, the Guatemalan jungle stretches out in every direction. An ocean of green swallowing the ancient Mayan city of Tikal.

The sun rises slowly. A thin mist burns off. Parrots, toucans — birds I can’t even name — take to the air. Somewhere in the distance, howler monkeys scream like something prehistoric waking up angry at the day.

Two spider monkeys hang upside down from fruit trees, calmly eating nuts, completely uninterested in us.

I’m here with a young German couple. We ran the last two kilometers to get here before the light changed. Climbed steep stone steps — narrow, brutal — the kind that remind you these places weren’t built for comfort, or safety, or tourists.

Twenty minutes later, we stop talking altogether.

There’s nothing left to say.

Across the jungle, nearly a kilometer away, the top of another pyramid breaks through the canopy. Two thousand years ago, slaves were sacrificed there to appease a god of death named Cizin.

Today, maybe fifteen tourists stand quietly on that same stone, watching the same sunrise.

For a brief moment — a rare one — everything feels simple.

Almost unbearably beautiful.

And completely insufficient.

I had moments like this all through Central America.

On the rim of an active volcano in Guatemala.  
Standing inside an esoteric church in Chiapas, surrounded by incense and chanting that felt older than language.

Pure, sublime beauty.

But that wasn’t the trip.

Those moments were just punctuation marks.

What mattered just as much — maybe more — was everything in between.

The confusion.  
The discomfort.  
The complexity.

## The Psychology of Arrival

Travel does things to your head.

You learn things about yourself you didn’t ask to learn.

For me, nothing is more revealing than arriving in a big city for the first time — especially at night.

Guatemala City.  
San Salvador.  
Expanses of concrete and noise.

I get defensive. I bury my face in a *Lonely Planet* guide, rereading sections called “Dangers and Annoyances.”

I just want a bed. A door that locks.

And of course, that’s exactly when nothing goes right.

One hotel full. Then another. Then a third.

A receptionist smiles — maybe amused, maybe indifferent — and tells me there’s no room.

A flicker of panic.

A few days later, I barely recognize that person.

The fear evaporates. Confidence takes over. Familiarity sets in. I walk the streets like they belong to me.

I’m exaggerating, sure. I’m not stupid enough to wander into the worst neighborhoods of Tegucigalpa on purpose.

But still — when it’s time to leave, I can’t understand how terrified I was that first night.

Something shifts.

## Complexity, Risk, and Motive

Why do we push ourselves into these situations?

Part of it — if I’m honest — might be something dark. A flirtation with danger. Call it recklessness. Call it defiance.

But deeper than that is something else.

A need to understand.

To see how people actually live.  
Not how we imagine they live.

In the West, we like simple stories about the global south.

“Third World.”  
“Developing countries.”

Words that flatten everything.

We’re taught that these places are passive. Broken. Waiting to be saved.

Politically, they’re reduced to pawns — pushed around by larger powers, first during the Cold War, now by global markets.

Yes — the history here is violent. Tragic. Full of hardship.

But it’s also full of resistance.

Throughout the twentieth century, these countries fought colonialism, dictatorship, repression.

Today, people here are on the front lines of globalization, environmental collapse, and economic inequality.

They are not footnotes.

Their leaders, their movements, their courage deserve the same respect we reserve for Western heroes — not pity, not distortion, not silence.

## Closing Turn

This trip — this search — wasn’t about answers.

It was about learning to sit with uncertainty.  
To accept discomfort.  
To trade simplicity for something harder — and more honest.

Because the world isn’t simple.

And if travel teaches you anything worth keeping, it’s that.

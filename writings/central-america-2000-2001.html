    </div>

    <p><strong>January 15th.</strong> Just after seven in the morning.</p>

    <p>I’m standing on top of a temple called <em>El Mundo Perdido</em> — “The Lost World.”</p>

    <p>Below me, the Guatemalan jungle stretches out in every direction. An ocean of green swallowing the ancient Mayan city of Tikal.</p>

    <p>The sun rises slowly. A thin mist burns off. Parrots, toucans — birds I can’t even name — take to the air. Somewhere in the distance, howler monkeys scream like something prehistoric waking up angry at the day.</p>

    <p>Two spider monkeys hang upside down from fruit trees, calmly eating nuts, completely uninterested in us.</p>

    <p>I’m here with a young German couple. We ran the last two kilometers to get here before the light changed. Climbed steep stone steps — narrow, brutal — the kind that remind you these places weren’t built for comfort, or safety, or tourists.</p>

    <p>Twenty minutes later, we stop talking altogether.</p>

    <p>There’s nothing left to say.</p>

    <p>Across the jungle, nearly a kilometer away, the top of another pyramid breaks through the canopy. Two thousand years ago, slaves were sacrificed there to appease a god of death named Cizin.</p>

    <p>Today, maybe fifteen tourists stand quietly on that same stone, watching the same sunrise.</p>

    <p>For a brief moment — a rare one — everything feels simple.</p>

    <p>Almost unbearably beautiful.</p>

    <p>And completely insufficient.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>I had moments like this all through Central America.</p>

    <p>On the rim of an active volcano in Guatemala.<br />
       Standing inside an esoteric church in Chiapas, surrounded by incense and chanting that felt older than language.</p>

    <p>Pure, sublime beauty.</p>

    <p>But that wasn’t the trip.</p>

    <p>Those moments were just punctuation marks.</p>

    <p>What mattered just as much — maybe more — was everything in between.</p>

    <p>The confusion. The discomfort. The complexity.</p>

    <h2>The Psychology of Arrival</h2>

    <p>Travel does things to your head.</p>

    <p>You learn things about yourself you didn’t ask to learn.</p>

    <p>For me, nothing is more revealing than arriving in a big city for the first time — especially at night.</p>

    <p>Guatemala City. San Salvador. Expanses of concrete and noise.</p>

    <p>I get defensive. I bury my face in a <em>Lonely Planet</em> guide, rereading sections called “Dangers and Annoyances.”</p>

    <p>I just want a bed. A door that locks.</p>

    <p>And of course, that’s exactly when nothing goes right.</p>

    <p>A few days later, I barely recognize that person.</p>

    <p>The fear evaporates. Confidence takes over. Familiarity sets in.</p>

    <p>Something shifts.</p>

    <h2>Complexity, Risk, and Motive</h2>

    <p>Why do we push ourselves into these situations?</p>

    <p>Part of it — if I’m honest — might be something dark. A flirtation with danger. Call it recklessness. Call it defiance.</p>

    <p>But deeper than that is something else.</p>

    <p>A need to understand.</p>

    <p>To see how people actually live. Not how we imagine they live.</p>

    <p>In the West, we like simple stories about the global south.</p>

    <p>“Third World.” “Developing countries.”</p>

    <p>Words that flatten everything.</p>

    <p>They are not footnotes.</p>

    <h2>Closing Turn</h2>

    <p>This trip — this search — wasn’t about answers.</p>

    <p>It was about learning to sit with uncertainty. To accept discomfort. To trade simplicity for something harder — and more honest.</p>

    <p>Because the world isn’t simple.</p>

    <p>And if travel teaches you anything worth keeping, it’s that.</p>

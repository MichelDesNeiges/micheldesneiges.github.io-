    <p><strong>November 22nd, 2000.</strong> Cancún, Mexico.</p>

    <p>I’m sitting comfortably on an Aero Cubana flight, headed for Havana, when a flight attendant leans over, hands out candy, and asks if this is my first time in Cuba.</p>

    <p>“Yes,” I tell her — in terrible Spanish. <em>Primera vez.</em></p>

    <p>Then, in English: “I’ve been dying to go.”</p>

    <p>An engine explodes behind my wing.</p>

    <p>The pilot comes on the intercom, calm, routine. Minor technical issues.</p>

    <p>A tourist in front of me turns around and says, dry as hell:</p>

    <p>“Welcome to Cuba.”</p>

    <h2>Arrival</h2>

    <p>When we finally land in Havana, customs takes two. Long. Frustrating.</p>

    <p>Instead of rushing outside, I collapse onto a bench and close my eyes.</p>

    <p>Exhausted. Impatient. A little disillusioned.</p>

    <h2>Havana</h2>

    <p>Havana is intoxicating.</p>

    <p>But if you step off the tourist routes — really step off — another Havana appears.</p>

    <p>The poverty isn’t hidden.</p>

    <p>But there is also sharing. A rough kind of equity.</p>

    <p>Healthcare and education are universal. And good.</p>

    <h2>Revolution</h2>

    <p>Castro is, undeniably, a dictator.</p>

    <p>Human rights violations are real.</p>

    <p>Cuba is not simple.</p>

    <p>But one thing is undeniable: the endurance of its people.</p>

    <h2>Pico Turquino</h2>

    <p>I see that endurance most clearly on Pico Turquino — the highest mountain in Cuba.</p>

    <p>I turn back before the summit.</p>

    <p>Angry. Exhausted. Furious at the guide. At them. At myself.</p>

    <p>Later, two young Cuban women knock on my door.</p>

    <p>One holds out a bowl.</p>

    <p>“Ice cream, Michel?”</p>

    <h2>Closing</h2>

    <p>I experienced many highs and lows in Cuba.</p>

    <p>But what stayed with me wasn’t ideology.</p>

    <p>It was warmth. Resilience. Human dignity.</p>

    <p><em>Viva Cuba.</em></p>
